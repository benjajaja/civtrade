Title: New CivTrade API + Auctions + Lots of random updates

**Before we get to the main points...**

/u/Eeazt made a [fantastic comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/2l01n6/civtrade_is_now_open_source_last_30_hours_of/clqucvw) a little bit ago:

>I'll absolutely be using this from now on **provided we can maneuver a mass transition from civcraftexchange over here.**

(Emphasis mine)

I'd like to ask you guys, what would it take to make a migration? As far as I can tell the only downside to CivTrade over /r/CivcraftExchange is the amount of people using the subreddit.

I'm only making this because I truly think it's a better alternative. I don't have ads, I don't charge diamonds for stickied posts, etc... It's all because I truly think we can make something better. 

**TL;DR: What would it take to make you move to CivTrade?**

**New API:**

I added a new API. You still must be verified to use it (verification takes about 10 seconds, if anyone needs help just PM me or post here).

The new API is located at http://civtrade.com/api/userPosts.php. You need your API token to view it. An API token can be accesed at any time by logging in to the control panel and scrolling all the way down to the [API Information panel](http://i.imgur.com/0H3gNm1.png)

This page returns a list of all users that have posted at least once, and their total posts. Currently, it returns:

`[{"name":"dx_dt","amount":9},{"name":"minicl55","amount":4},{"name":"Higgenbottoms","amount":3},{"name":"GipsyKing","amount":2},{"name":"Darcour","amount":2},{"name":"dekecoy","amount":1},{"name":"wildman01","amount":1},{"name":"agentnola","amount":1},{"name":"iPublicFriendemy","amount":1},{"name":"NetherQuit","amount":1},{"name":"BlazinGoliath","amount":1},{"name":"72Volt","amount":1},{"name":"597","amount":1},{"name":"assassin_scooby","amount":1},{"name":"MonsieurWTF","amount":1},{"name":"comicguyben","amount":1},{"name":"cwdeathsword","amount":1},{"name":"IronicChef","amount":1},{"name":"TealNerd","amount":1},{"name":"sintralin","amount":1}]`

This API takes no argruemnts. 

If you're getting the error `Invalid API token OR your account is not verified OR your API token has been suspended`, you have an invalid API token, your account isn't verified or your API token has been suspended. PM me on reddit if you have any troubles.

***If you need an API made, tell me. The reason there's only one right now is because that's the only one that's been requested. I'm very open to making new ones to meet someone's specific needs***

**Auctions:**

A brand new feature has been added, auctions! Auctions are simple to set up. The old "create new post" system has been [slightly upgraded](https://i.imgur.com/GA1DuvH.png). A new field has been added to the bottom, "minimum auction increase".

To show how auctions work, I will make one and document it.

First, fill in all the fields in the new offer box, [like this](https://i.imgur.com/8FzS0dX.png) and click "create auction"

The card will look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/kkSgdeq.png), which is slightly different than a [non auction card](https://i.imgur.com/vxgrE1s.png). You are automatically set to the last bidder.

Now, anyone can bid on your auction. [This is a picture of what it looks like to people other than the poster](https://i.imgur.com/Fe2pwlO.png). 

If you want to bid on an auction, click "increase bid by [amount] [item]". [This is a picture of what happened after I clicked the bid button on my alt](https://i.imgur.com/X1PGPbD.png)

Three things you should notice:

1) The current price went up by 3

2) The newest bidder was changed to my alt (minicl66). Additionally, because this account is unverified, a **unverified** tag was added to the name

3) I can no longer click the button, as I am the top bidder.

To end the auction, log in as the poster and click "Mark inactive". An auction can be brought back at any time by clicking "Show your inactive posts" and clicking "mark active"

**Post directly to /r/CivcraftExchange**

All users may now post directly to /r/CivcraftExchange with the push of a button. This just opens up a tab with the information pre-set in the title/message box, the user must still click submit new post.

----

**New semi-important stuff:**

- Added settings

  A new [settings panel](https://i.imgur.com/gJMi5Yq.png) has been added to the user control panel page. Currently the only two options are to lock the navbar and remove the "Now open source!" href from the navbar, but if anyone wants more options, just tell me and I'll add it.
  
  Both settings default to false and are false for any user not logged in.

- Removed relative timestamps. And non-relative timestamps. Actually, the entire post info thing has been removed.

- Added new API

- Added auctions

- Added a way to reset your password (just log on to CivCraft and type /msg gastriko register resetpw)

- PM system has been taken down, just for a little bit. for now, use reddit messaging.

- Fixed a few issues with items not returning values

- City names now must match a city on Txapu

- Added a new button to post directly to /r/CivCraftExchange
