CivTrade
========

I'm working on making [CivTrade](http://civtrade.com) open-sourced, primarily because open-sourcing projects that you don't make money off of is always a good idea.

Pull requests are always welcome.

**You cannot simply download and put these files on your server as you need to set up a valid SQL connection.**.
