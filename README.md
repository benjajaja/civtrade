CivTrade
========

I'm working on making [CivTrade](http://civtrade.com) open-sourced, primarily because open-sourcing projects that you don't make money off of is always a good idea.

Pull requests are always welcome.

This is released under the MIT licence, **basically** meaning you can do whatever you want with my code as long as you give me credit in a licence file and redistribute it with the same licence. I have the right to change this at my discresion and you should check the LICENCE file for more up-to-date information and a more detailed statement.

**You cannot simply download and put these files on your server as you need to set up a valid SQL connection.**.
